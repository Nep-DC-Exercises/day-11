### Summary

Today we were introduced to Big O Notation and experimented with navigating merge conflicts in git.

Big O Notation was kind of confusing at first but is slowly starting to make sense. The MIT Computer Science video helps clarify the topic some more. I can see how ensuring your code remains efficient as its inputs grow larger is a valuable skill for a developer to possess.

This repo contains a bubble_sort function and anagram challenge from hackerrank. I couldn't quite solve the bubble_sort in class on Friday but upon review tonight, I could complete it.

The anagram challenge from hackerrank took some time to complete. The logic to convert the strings into substrings and to create a dictionary with letter frequency wasn't challenging. What was difficult was calculating the correct answer; How many letters in substring 1 did you have to change to match the letters in substring 2? Writing pseudocode with pen and paper helped plus reviewing the correct outputs versus my outputs on the hackerrank platform helped me figure out the eventual answer.
